# Bash scripts
Tested on a Windows 10 machine using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Ubuntu bash command line.

* clear-keyboard.sh - Crush, kill, and destroy all local Q signals.  Handy if you've set the side pipes by accident, because in the current UI you can't delete them.
* gradient.sh - Set a color gradient on the keyboard. Defaults to going from red to blue, but accepts arguments.
* qcloud.sh - Check to see if the cloud API is available. If not, make the Q key breathe red.
